\section{Project Outline}

Antibiotic resistance is one of, if not the, most important issue in modern medicine.  Despite the massive prevalence of antibiotic usage, with over 260,000,000 prescriptions 
being issued in the US alone each year, surprisingly little is known about the underlying pharmacodynamics, and what factors influence the emergence of resistance.  This lack 
of understanding is becoming increasingly critical as our supply of viable antibiotics dwindles in comparison to the increasing number of resistant strains of bacteria.  In 
2014 there were over 480,000 cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis reported, with only half of those cases able to be successfully treated.  Experts estimate that if current trends 
continue, the number of deaths caused by drug-resistant bacteria will number in the millions, making further research in the field vital.

Due to the enormity of this issue, it would be foolish to leave the responsibility of progress to just the biologists and chemists of the world.  This project therefore aims to 
use stochastic computational modelling techniques to glean insight on how the presence of antibiotics influence bacterial colonies from a more physics based perspective.  In 
particular, this project aims to investigate the impact of the application of antibiotics in the form of a gradient e.g., in the scenario of when drugs would be applied to a biofilm.  


While these findings will obviously have important medical applications, they could also be of benefit in more industrial applications.  In particular, impeding, or even halting the 
formation of biofilm formation on industrial shipping vessels.  The shipping industry currently consumes an exorbitant amount of fuel.  If it was a sovereign nation, it would be 
the 7$^{\textrm{th}}$ largest producer of CO$_2$ on the planet and it's estimated that up to 


\subsection*{Progress so far}

So far several investigations have been performed into the effects of antibiotic gradients on the evolution and proliferation of bacterial colonies.  The first project 
undertaken was to replicate the results of a PRL paper co-authored by my supervisor, which modelled how the steepness of antibiotic gradients in conjunction with differing 
mutational pathways affected the time taken for resistance to emerge.  This was primarily intended as a ``warm-up'' project, in order to gain familiarity with modelling these 
sorts of systems, and to build a foundation upon which further projects could be built. These simulations consisted of a simple 1D system 

Following on from this, work on the next project began swiftly.  This was 

\subsection*{Outlook}

Following a meeting with our industrial partners AkzoNobel, it was decided that work would continue for the meanwhile on the nascent multispecies model.  They mentioned how 
designing the right combination and release schedule of antimicrobials in order to promote the emergence of favourable biofilm compositions was of particular interest to them, 
so they intend to send us data on various bacterial species and their corresponding growth rates/susceptibilities to several biocides such that they could be incorporated into 
the multispecies model in order to deliver more quantitative, rather than simple proof-of-concept results.

% for your intended area of study and {\bf your progress to date}. 
% This should concentrate on why this subject

\section{Critical Dependencies}

If there are {\it critical dependencies} in your research work, detail them
here, for example 
``{\it\ldots my experimental work depend on the LHC being fixed\ldots}'' 
and what steps have been taken to deal(?) with them.

Also in this section outline any concerns about your progress, and 
in particular any aspect that you feel are impeding your progress.
